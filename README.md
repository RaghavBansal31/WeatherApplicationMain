       This is my Weather Application Using UIkit:
       
        1. Search Feature
        2. Core location
        3. MVVM
        4. Error Handling
        5. Crucial UI Componets
        6. Pull To refresh
        7. URLSession
        8. Constraints
      
      
      
        1. When the application is build, a dashboad will open up with a search bar and tableview.
        2. Type the city name in the search bar and hit enter
        3. A cell with the city name will be displayed in the tableview
        4. When you click the row cell, it takes to a detailed view page where the weather info of the mentioned city is displayed
        5. A grid collection view is also used to display the time and temperature forecast of the coming 5 days with a horizonatal scroll
        6. Navigation is used and we can go back to the first page.
      
        The number of times a city name is entered and enter button is pressed that city will be added in the tableview and kill keep of adding
        until the tableview is pulled to refresh and the already displayed city will be erased and the tableview will be reset and then using 
        core location the  current location city will be displayed in the tableview
      
        For me the project is showing Sanfransico as If you're running your app in the iOS Simulator, it defaults to a location in San Francisco.
